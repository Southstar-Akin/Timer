      My name is Akinbile Oluwaseyi Tony <br>
      I am a Front End Web developer and You are currently on my Time App <br>
      Building this app was been very tasking as it would be the first project I'd build without a tutorial. <br>
      Whenever I Got stuck I redeployed to use online resources like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">"Stack overflow"</a>,
       <a href="https://Google.com">"Google"</a>, <a href="https://w3schools.com">"W3schools"</a> <br>
       And they were very Helpful, the vast knowledge of developers that have come before me cemented in Code for generations to come, 
       I can't be more grateful. Big shout out to them. I hope to contribute something that another developer would find useful one day <br>
      If You would s to hear more about it You could reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/akinbiletony">"Twitter"</a>
       or check out my code on <a href="https://github.com/Southstar-Akin/Timer">"Github"</a>. <br>
        I also have Plans of building a Blog to document my Webdev Journey,
       So follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/akinbiletony">"Twitter"</a> and keep your eyes peeled for updates. If you'd love to check that out. <br>
       I am currently on the look out for Internship Opportunties Or Jobs, I am sound in programming languages such as HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT and
        frameworks like TAILWIND CSS, currently learning REACT JS as of the time of this publication. <br>
         When I'm not coding, I'm listening to or writing Music, 
        I am also a First Year Student of the University Of Ibadan studying Mechanical Engineering But my session is currently On hold due to
        Financial crisis in the Country. Being out of school played a huge part amongst factors the made me start to code. <br>
         I Hope you enjoyed the app. If you have any suggestions 
        you'd like to point the out to me, reach out to me on my <a href="https://github.com/Southstar-Akin/Timer">"Github"</a> profile, You can also reach out to me for collaborations @ my <a href="https://twitter.com/akinbiletony">"Twitter"</a>. <br>
